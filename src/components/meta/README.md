# Meta component

A collection of default, no frills, no configuration wanted meta tags.
Ideal for starting a project and wanting to cover the basics.

This component takes in a limited set of props to build meta elements that keeps end users browsers 🧑‍💻, search engine crawlers 🕸 (aka Google, Bing) and social crawlers 👯‍♂️ (aka Twitter, Facebook and LinkedIn) all happy.

This component has been kept purposefully simple for ease of use.
